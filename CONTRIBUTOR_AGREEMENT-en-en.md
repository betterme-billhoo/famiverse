<br/><br/><br/>

## II. Core Values

- We often use technology to serve others and companies.But in our quiet hours, we can also use it to build something meaningful for our own children and familiesâ€”something that brings them more happiness, more possibilities.
- We believe that the true purpose of family education is not to cram knowledge or chase test scores, but to nurture the **courage**, **capacity**, and **conviction** to pursue happiness, appreciate beauty, and face the future.When all the facts and formulas are forgotten, what remains in a child's heartâ€”the warmth, the values, the sense of wonderâ€”that is what matters most, and what we strive to cultivate.

<br/><br/><br/>

## III. Goals

Create an open, sustainable, and unlimited family education platform.Fostering a child's internal drive and lifelong learning habits through 3D visualization, gamification mechanisms and AI support to enable the child to grow in a comprehensive and integrated manner across five essential dimensions: **Character**, **Wisdom**, **Body**, **Aesthetics**, and **Practice**.

- The platform focuses on family education and lifelong learning.
- The users of this platform: Children (from elementary school through university, and even into adulthood) and their parents.
- This platform is designed to effectively ignite children's intrinsic motivation, foster their ability for self-directed learning, and help them develop lifelong learning habits.
- This platform is dedicated to helping children achieve well-rounded and balanced development across character, intellect, physical health, aesthetic appreciation, and practical skills, guiding them to grow into truly happy individuals â€” not just those considered "excellent" by others.
- This platform effectively fosters children's holistic, interdisciplinary thinking habits and practical abilities, guiding them to grow into well-rounded and comprehensively developed individuals.
- his platform will be a universe â€” a true, ever-expanding cosmos.This universe will evoke a sense of infinity, mystery, and an endless desire to explore and learn in both children and parents.
